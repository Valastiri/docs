# How

- avoid screenshots for now - use placeholders instead (exception is flight-deck overview)   
  - text, dummy-image or similar A32NX images
- do not add notes to features if available or not. These will still change a lot and we will do it 
  shortly before release
- otherwise use the A32NX docs as a guide for the content - if you think you can improve on the pages 
  in the A32NX docs, feel free to do so for the A380X docs. But we recommend to not make your life 
  unnecessarily difficult

# TODO

1. Navigation restructuring for multiple aircraft
2. Content restructuring for common content for both aircraft
3. Create scaffolding navigation for new aircraft sections
4. Create scaffolding content for new aircraft sections
5. Content creation for new aircraft sections in roughly this priority order:
   1. Beginner Guide 
   2. Update common pages to refer to both projects and aircraft 
      - (e.g. homepage, Overview pages, FAQ, Support Guide, release notes, common questions, Install Guide, etc.)
   3. Common Features (depending on structure) - e.g. EFB, Tiller, and such...)
   4. ...
