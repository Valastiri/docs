# Remote SimBridge

This guide details how to run SimBridge on a remote machine and connect to it from your local machine (where your simulator is running).

!!! warning "For Advanced Users"
    This guide is intended for advanced users who are familiar with networking and have a good understanding of how to configure their network to allow remote connections. If you are not familiar with networking, we recommend you do not attempt to follow this guide.

    While the benefits of running SimBridge on an external machine are few it would allow to users offload some resources from your local machine. If you encounter any issues please resort to this 
    guide or use SimBridge on your local machine (the same one with MSFS running). Contact our Discord support if you do wish to troubleshoot this feature.
